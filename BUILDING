To build and install kivaloo, run:
# make BINDIR=/path/to/target/directory install

Kivaloo should build and run on any IEEE Std 1003.1 (POSIX) compliant system
which includes the Software Development Utilities and Threads options.  If it
doesn't, this is a bug -- please report it!


Platform-specific notes
-----------------------

- The performance of SSL networking can be improved if SO_NOSIGPIPE is
  available in <sys/socket.h>.  To get this in FreeBSD, define __BSD_VISIBLE,
  for example:
      make CFLAGS="-O2 -g -D__BSD_VISIBLE"
